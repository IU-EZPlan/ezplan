## Project Description: Tour Management System
Planning a tour can get cumbersome if you have to visit different applications for different purposes like finalizing the places to visit, searching accommodation, identifying travel routes, getting those tickets, fixing a schedule, and locking on to that itinerary after several rounds of changes. The Tour Management System tries to solve these problems. The website will let users search for places, routes, and allow accommodations and travel bookings. A plan will be shared amongst all the travelers in the group so that everyone can see and make comments. The application will generate an itinerary based on what places the user has selected and what bookings are done. Users may enter their availability and the application can fix a common time. Allow the user to visualize their route with maps and distances to come up with an optimized plan. The website can make suggestions based on previous ratings. The scope can be narrowed down by targeting specific audiences/tours like a Bike Tour/Business Tour etc

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
