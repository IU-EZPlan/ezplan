## Project Description: Tour Management System
Planning a tour can get cumbersome if you have to visit different applications for different purposes like finalizing the places to visit, searching accommodation, identifying travel routes, getting those tickets, fixing a schedule, and locking on to that itinerary after several rounds of changes. The Tour Management System tries to solve these problems. The website will let users search for places, routes, and allow accommodations and travel bookings. A plan will be shared amongst all the travelers in the group so that everyone can see and make comments. The application will generate an itinerary based on what places the user has selected and what bookings are done. Users may enter their availability and the application can fix a common time. Allow the user to visualize their route with maps and distances to come up with an optimized plan. The website can make suggestions based on previous ratings. The scope can be narrowed down by targeting specific audiences/tours like a Bike Tour/Business Tour etc
